  Overview of DSP concepts, visualized through GNU Radio flowgraphs. 
  Upon compilation of the flowgraphs, the resultant scripts enabled students to receive WBFM, 
  AM, & other modulated signals, including digital transmission.

## Overview (TL;DR)
In this workshop, I built flowgraphs and generated from said flowgraphs. The encompassing material serves as a very easy and simple-to-follow setup of a transceiver setup, so as to introduce students to large scale (not in terms of size, but in components and system complexity), more commercial systems.
