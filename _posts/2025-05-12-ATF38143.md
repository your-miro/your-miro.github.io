## Overview (TL;DR)

This project presents the design of a 1.8 GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) using the ATF38143 pHEMT transistor. The objective is to achieve a noise figure below 1.2 dB while maximizing operating gain through proper biasing, broadband stabilization, and impedance matching. The design follows a full RF workflow: DC bias point selection, stability conditioning, noise/gain circle analysis for Γ-selection, and microstrip matching network synthesis on RO4003 substrate. The final amplifier is implemented entirely in ADS using realistic component and layout constraints suitable for fabrication and measurement.

## Design Specifications

Methodology
1. Device Selection and Workspace Setup

The ATF-38143 low-noise pHEMT was selected for its low noise figure and adequate gain in the 1–2 GHz range. The ADS transistor model was imported from the provided ATF38143.zap workspace, as required in the course project brief 

The device was configured in common-source mode with both source leads grounded.

2. DC Characterization and Bias Point Selection

DC I–V curves were generated by sweeping:

$$ V_{GS} \in \left[-0.6\,\text{V},\,+0.6\,\text{V}\right] $$


$$ V_{DS} \in \left[0\,\text{V},\,4\,\text{V}\right] $$



The bias point was selected to achieve both linearity and low-noise operation near the transistor’s optimum noise bias:

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| $$V_{DS}$$ | $$2.25 \text{V}$$ |
| $$I_{DS}$$ | $$150 \text{mA}$$ |
| $$V_{GS}$$ | $$0.111 \text{V}$$ |


This satisfies the design flow described in Section 4.1 of the project handout 

3. Practical DC Feed and DC Block Network

Ideal elements were replaced with realizable lumped/microstrip components:

Component	Purpose	Placeholder
DC Block Capacitor	RF pass / DC isolation	10,000 pF
DC Feed (λ/4 stub)	DC pass / RF open	Electrical length ~90° (physical 935 mil)

The λ/4 line was synthesized using LineCalc as described in the impedance matching handout 

4. Stability Analysis and Stabilization Network

S-parameter simulation from 200 MHz to 10 GHz was used to verify unconditional stability via the stability factor (K > 1) and stability measure (μ > 0), following Section 4.3 of the rubric 


Stabilization Element	Placement	Placeholder
Series/Shunt Resistor	Input 4.64Ω or output	6.81Ω

The stabilized device maintained unconditional stability across the desired band.

5. Noise and Gain Circles → Γ-Selection

At 1.8 GHz, noise and gain circles were plotted to choose the source and load reflection coefficients that meet design goals NF ≤ 1.2 dB and “as high as possible” gain:

$$	\text{Γ}_S = 0.388 ∠{-159.089^{\circ}} $$

$$	\text{Γ}_L = 0.260 ∠{143.226^{\circ}}$$

This step corresponds to Section 4.4 of the project documentation 

6. Matching Network Synthesis (Ideal → Real)

Matching began with ideal transmission line elements (TLIN/TLOC). Once validated, the design was translated into microstrip using RO4003 substrate parameters:

Parameter	Placeholder
εr	3.55 (RO4003)
W (line width)	43.91 mil
L (line length)	50.00 mil

Physical dimensions were synthesized using LineCalc and refined through tuning, per the design flow in the ADS matching handouts .

7. Final Amplifier Assembly & Performance Extraction

The two-port matching networks were then cascaded with the stabilized, biased transistor. Final S-parameter simulations yielded:

| | Theoretical (dB) | Acheived (dB) |
|:--          |:--:      |:--:       |
| Noise Factor Min |     1.2      |     1.197      |
| Operating Gain Max   |     -     |     18.345      |

These results satisfy the performance targets defined for Teams 3/4/7/8 in Table 1 of the rubric document
