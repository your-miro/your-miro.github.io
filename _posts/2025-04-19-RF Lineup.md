## Overview (TL;DR)
The simulated RF transmitter chain successfully converted a 100 MHz digital IF signal to a 1.8425 GHz RF output within the DCS-1800 band, achieving a measured output power of 17.48 mW (12.4 dBm), slightly below the 25 mW (13.98 dBm) target. The spectral analysis confirmed that undesired mixing products and harmonic emissions were significantly attenuated, demonstrating the system's spectral efficiency. However, local oscillator (LO) leakage was observed, possibly requiring further suppression to meet regulatory compliance. The custom-designed bandpass filter effectively eliminated out-of-band signals, reinforcing the system’s suitability for operation within the specified frequency band.

## Introduction
This project implements a superheterodyne RF transmitter operating in the DCS-1800 band, converting a 100 MHz digital IF signal to a 1.8425 GHz RF output with a target power of 25mW. The system is designed using Mini-Circuits components and modeled in ADS, with simulations performed using a Harmonic Balance controller to evaluate performance, spectral integrity, and unwanted emissions.
## Procedure
### Initial simulation with connectorized filter
This design aims to convert a 100 MHz digital IF signal into a 1.8425 GHz radio frequency (RF) signal in the DCS-1800 frequency band, producing 25 mW of output power from a 1 μW input. The Mini-Circuits components used were chosen based on datasheet specifications:
-	ZFL-1000 (low-frequency amplifier)
-	ZX05-30W-S+ (mixer)
-	ZX75BP-1842-S+ (bandpass filter)
-	ZX60-33LN-S+ (RF amplifier)

Their specified datasheet parameters (reflection coefficients, gain compression, and filter characteristics) were then input, and modeled in ADS.
A superheterodyne transmitter (Tx) architecture was adopted, and the system was simulated using a Harmonic Balance controller to accommodate multiple frequencies. In ADS, two signals (IF_Freq = 100 MHz and LO_Freq = 1842.5 MHz) and their fifth-order harmonics were included:		
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Order\[1\] = 5, Order\[2\] = 5)

To focus on principal mixing products, namely IF_Freq ± LO_Freq—the maximum mixing order was set to 2. Notably, the mixer’s reflection coefficients (S11, S22, S33) were not used. Once configured, the simulation confirmed that the final amplifier stage could achieve the desired 25 mW output at 1.8425 GHz.

Figure 2: Harmonic Balance Simulation Results

The top trace (Red: IF_Amp) illustrates the intermediate frequency (IF) signal at 100 MHz after amplification by the low-frequency amplifier. The dominant tone at 100 MHz is clearly visible, accompanied by smaller harmonic and spurious signals.

The second trace (Blue: Mix_Out) represents the output of the frequency mixer. Here, the local oscillator (LO) feedthrough is visible, along with the sum and difference frequency components (IF ± LO). Additional spurious and side frequencies appear due to the mixing process and harmonic generation.

The third trace (Magenta: Filt_Out) demonstrates the effect of the bandpass filter, which is centered around 1.842 GHz. The filter significantly attenuates unwanted frequencies, allowing only the LO ± IF components near the carrier frequency to remain, which were passed because they are in the passband of the connectorized filter component which is larger than the operating band. However, these components are unwanted frequencies as they are outside of the DCS-1800 frequency band.

The bottom trace (Purple: Vout) depicts the final output after the RF amplifier. Two strong tones, labeled as the lower sideband (LSB) and upper sideband (USB), are observed near 1.84 GHz. Their measured power levels are 9.452 dBm and 9.377 dBm, respectively. The small power difference of only 0.075 dB between the two tones highlights the system's robustness in maintaining nearly equal output levels, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving signal integrity.

Upon further examination of the output spectrum, we observe that, in addition to the LO±IF signal components, there are unintended emissions at harmonic frequencies and their respective mixing products. These spurious emissions, however, are at significantly lower power levels compared to the main output signal and are generally considered negligible. Notably, there is a prominent leakage at the local oscillator frequency (LO_Freq), situated between the two primary tones. This LO leakage is a common occurrence in RF systems, often resulting from imperfections in mixer isolation and inadequate suppression of the LO signal within the Tx circuitry.

### Power Calculation of the Two Main Tones at Vout

To find their combined power, first convert each tone from dBm to linear power (mW), add the powers, and then convert back to dBm:
P1=10^(9.452/10)  mW ≈ 8.8145 mW	P2 = 10^(9.377/10)  mW ≈ 8.663 mW

Ptotal = P1+P2 ≈ 17.48 mW

Combined Power (dBm)= 10 log_10⁡〖(17.5 mW)〗 ≈ 12.4 dBm.
Thus, the total power at the output is about 17.48mW/12.4 dBm which is just short of the required 25mW/13.98 dBm required for an input of /-30 dBm.

### Simulation with designed filter

The previous section’s RF Transmitter Chain was replicated with a filter built using the Design Wizard on ADS. The specifications were as follows:

Figure 3: Filter Specifications

It is important to note that with the provided specifications, the filter will greatly attenuate the two RF tones that will exist at 1.742GHz & 1.942GHz as they are situated in the stop-band of the filter response curve, leaving only the leakage LO frequency. This is done to examine the new filter’s ability to remove these components which exist outside of its operating region (DCS-1800 frequency band).

The new schematic is illustrated below with the new “DA_LCBandpassDT1” component denoting the new “custom” filter.

Table 1
By analyzing the results of this simulation with the Customized Filter component, we can determine that frequencies outside the center of the band (1.845 GHz) will be greatly attenuated. The two out-of-band tones in this simulation were decreased to -112dBm & -106dBm which are insignificant power levels, and are comparable to the harmonics that exist far from the desired band. This illustrates the strength of this design in the specified DCS-1800 frequency band.
Conclusion
The simulated RF transmitter chain successfully converted a 100 MHz digital IF signal to a 1.8425 GHz RF output within the DCS-1800 band, achieving a measured output power of 17.48 mW (12.4 dBm), slightly below the 25 mW (13.98 dBm) target. The spectral analysis confirmed that undesired mixing products and harmonic emissions were significantly attenuated, demonstrating the system's spectral efficiency. However, local oscillator (LO) leakage was observed, possibly requiring further suppression to meet regulatory compliance. The custom-designed bandpass filter effectively eliminated out-of-band signals, reinforcing the system’s suitability for operation within the specified frequency band.
