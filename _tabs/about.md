That being said, most of the work on this website entails concepts in RF/microwave engineering and machine learning, designing and benchmarking transmitter chains while operating RF measurement rigs and connectorized components. My day-to-day spans system modeling, test automation, and telecom subsystem analysis, with a focus on spectral efficiency, signal integrity, and repeatable lab workflows.

Current research centers on power-amplifier linearization using advanced ML, including architecture-matched modeling to align nonlinearity behavior across similar PA topologies. I received an AUS Undergraduate Research Grant for this effort and continue to refine compensation strategies that improve EVM and adjacent-channel performance under realistic drive conditions. In addition to another grant for my work on [an ADRV9026-based measurement system](({{ '/_posts/2025-10-19-SDP_ADRV9026' | relative_url }})).

## More Personal Work Includes...
Designing a Phase-Locked Loop for a Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave Ground Penetrating Radar using ADIsimPLL and Analog Devices’ ADF4159, achieving exceptionally low frequency and phase error for clean chirp generation and robust time–frequency coherence 
(<span style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#1d4ed8;">[System build ongoing]({{ site.baseurl }}/_posts/2025-01-05-PLL for GPR)</span>).
Complementing this, I earned a professional certificate in PCB fabrication (2023), built 
[a 1.8 GHz Class-A single-transistor PA](({{ '/_posts/2025-05-12-ATF38143' | relative_url }}))
, and executed multi-layer PCB processes from layout through chemical etching. Beyond single blocks, I’ve planned 
[complete RF line-ups](({{ '/_posts/2025-04-29-RF Lineup' | relative_url }})) 
in Keysight ADS  to a fixed budget and target transmission characteristics (C/IMD3 and P1dB), translating datasheet constraints into practical design trade-offs.

Outside the lab, I have organized an [IEEE ComSoc workshop at AUS using SDRs and GNU Radio](({{ '/_posts/GNU Radio Workshop' | relative_url }}))—demonstrating analog modulation chains and digital payload construction with BPSK, QPSK, and QAM. I’m currently developing a third-party applet for the ADRV9026 evaluation kit to interface with the onboard FPGA, automate waveform configuration and TX/RX scripting, benchmark DUTs, and characterize memory effects and static nonlinearities for next-gen transceivers.
